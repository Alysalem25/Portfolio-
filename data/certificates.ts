This year, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the Beamline for Schools competition, organized by CERN, one of the world‚Äôs most prestigious scientific organizations. Our team proudly represented Egypt as we submitted our proposal for a scientific experiment using a particle beamline! üí°üî¨
I was fortunate to work alongside an amazing team: Malak Mahmoud, Mohamed A. Bakry, malak agbo, Jassmin Agbo , Omar Hamed, Youssef Mahmoud, and Sajed Reda. Together, we combined our talents and diverse perspectives to create something truly unique. The experience taught us the real power of teamwork, as we collaborated closely, leveraging each member‚Äôs strengths to bring our project to life.
Participating in this competition was more than just an academic exercise‚Äîit was a chance to dive deep into the world of particle physics and gain invaluable insights from top scientists at CERN. I‚Äôm beyond grateful for this journey, which not only sharpened our scientific skills but also strengthened our ability to work together as a cohesive team.
Looking forward to applying these lessons and continuing to explore the fascinating world of physics and technology!
